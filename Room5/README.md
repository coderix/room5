Room5 is a windows UWP tool for managing room occupation plans in a school. Classrooms are not occupied for time hours, but for lessons. Assignments are displayed on a weekly basis. The Occupancy page displays the available rooms for each lesson in a week. From there they can also be booked immediately. There are one-time and recurring bookings. Currently, there are only weekly recurring transactions with no finish date. Double bookings are not allowed. When you book a room, it checks whether there are future bookings. If this is the case,a recurring booking is excluded.

The development of the app is far away from being complete. The first release will be functionally very limited. This is my first c\#- and Windows project. I would therefore ask for leniency for the code, which is certainly highly in need of improvement. There is no localization, all texts of the interface are German.

The data is stored in a local SQLite database or a mysql database.
